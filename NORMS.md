#Array of Gems 
##E-commerce website for gem sales.

##This document describes our team social contract for this project

##Reference Establishing Norms

##Roles
* Taskmaster
* Gitmaster
* Testmaster

##Daily process
* Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster
* New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
* Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)

##Pair program on assigned tasks
* We will include in the specific issue/todo if it requires 2 programmers. 
* We can talk about each morning in our standup if that todo will be done today and will require the 2 programmers. 
* When working with 2 programmers we will section off the work so that the pair programmers switch each section rather than relying on a timer. 
* You can also switch it up if you hit an issue or are stuck.
* At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
* Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master

## Team expectations

* Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
* Everyone is allowed to work from home. We will let each other know before the end of the day if we plan to work from home. Each person will only work on the tickets they are assigned to and will not take on someone else's work. We will be sure to complete a pull in the morning as a group to be sure everyone is on the same up to date master.
* If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought


#Issues

## If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
* We will always get an outsiders perspective. 
* If two team members are peer programing the third member can weigh in or we can fill out a help ticket if we all disagree. We will have the PM weigh in if one way/choice will be more beneficial.

## If you are frustrated
* The individual should take a break for 5-15mins. 
* Talk constructively with you team as a whole for 10-15mins. 
* If the issue cannot be resolved as a team then call in a third party, PM, to be sure the issue can be resolved effectively.
